Summary

- Driver I: Washington Post website was not converting visits to video starts 

Solution: Develop a captive audience using modern web techniques like gamification and infinite scroll

- Driver II: Social Media referrals were dropping, reducing video starts as a result 

Solution: Follow up on a previous beta test and increase natively uploaded videos to social media 

- Driver III: Web traffic was dropping or stalling during historically peak hours and night shifts

Solution: Leverage peak hours for promoted content and popular content, cultivate new audience during the night shift

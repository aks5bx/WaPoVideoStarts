# Washington Post Video Starts Diagnosis 

## Overview 

Using mocked data supplied by the Washington Post, this project diagnoses the causes and assesses the severity of the drop in video starts experienced in October 2017. The analysis also develops a sustainable solution to the issue by identifying three key drivers. 

## Report 

The report is detailed in a powerpoint that is included in this repository as a PDF, found [here](https://github.com/aks5bx/WaPoVideoStarts/blob/main/WapoPresentation.pdf).

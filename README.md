# Washington Post Video Starts Diagnosis

Using mocked data supplied by the Washington Post, this project seeks to understand the causes and the severity of the drop in video starts experienced in October 2017. The analysis also develops a sustainable solution to the issue by identifying three key drivers. 

Summary

- Driver I: Washington Post website was not converting visits to video starts 

Solution: Develop a captive audience using modern web techniques like gamification and infinite scroll

- Driver II: Social Media referrals were dropping, reducing video starts as a result 

Solution: Follow up on a previous beta test and increase natively uploaded videos to social media 

- Driver III: Web traffic was dropping or stalling during historically peak hours and night shifts

Solution: Leverage peak hours for promoted content and popular content, cultivate new audience during the night shift
